        was reported on Gitter, requests that are made with a `Content-Type` of `text/plain`
        get resolved to the `:conf` format and consequently a `.txt` template is never
        used.\r\n\r\nThat happens because we use `Rack::Mime::MIME_TYPES.key(mime_type)`
        [(see here)](https://github.com/hanami/controller/blob/master/lib/hanami/action/mime.rb#L486)
        which returns only the first match. The same problem can happen for a bunch
        of other types (around 40) and we never detected this problem because we skipped
        those cases on purpose on the tests [(see here)](https://github.com/hanami/controller/blob/master/test/action/format_test.rb#L85)\r\n\r\nMaking
        it work is kinda of a huge change. Why? For that to work we''d need to make
        `Hanami::Action#format` an `Array` or make `Hanami::View` (specially the template
        finder) MIME aware and make it look for the first template file it finds with
        the possible extensions.\r\n\r\nThat would warrant changes in `view`, `controller`
        and possibly `hanami`, and that brings me here. I''m willing to work at it
        but I''d like some input from the hanami members on the best way to tackle
        this.","closed_by":null}'
